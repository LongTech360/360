                            West Africa’s voice on the bench of the world’s top judicial body. The event, held in Abuja, brought together members of the diplomatic corps and senior government officials, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Yusuf Tuggar, 
                            led the endorsement of Dr Elias’ candidacy. Tuggar highlighted the absence of West African representation on the ICJ since 2011 and Nigeria’s lack of presence on the court for more than three decades.
                            “This long absence is not a matter of pride but of perspective. It underscores the importance of equitable geographical representation and the need for voices from West Africa to again be heard within the world’s highest judicial body”.</p>
