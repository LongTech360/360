                        <p class="news-meta">By Admin | Today, 2025</p>
                        <p class="news-excerpt truncated-text" >ABUJA – THE nominee of President Bola Tinubu, Prof. Joash Ojo Amupitan SAN, as Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is already at the Senate Chamber for the screening exercise. <br> <br>
                        <span class="hidden-text">
                            Thereafter, he came in at 12.50 pm. Before introducing himself to the Senators for the question and answer session to take off, the President of the Senate, Senator Godswill Akpabio, disclosed to his colleagues that the nominee had been
                            cleared by the office of the National Security Adviser, NSA, after vetting and fingerprinting.
                            According to Akpabio, the office of the Department of State Services, DSS, had also cleared him.
                            The President of the Senate also said that the Office of the Inspector-General of Police, IGP, having done a fingerprint search on him, he was cleared and said that he has no criminal records with the Police.
                            Amupitan is at the moment giving the Senators his resume.<br> <br>
                            Recall that President Bola Tinubu had on Tuesday written to the Senate, where he sought the screening and subsequent confirmation of Professor Joash Amupitan ( SAN) as new National Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for confirmation.
                            The President, in a letter which was read by the President of the Senate, Senator Godswill Akpabio, was seeking expeditious consideration and approval by the Senate.
                            The letter read: “In accordance with the provisions of section 154 subsection 1 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 as amended, I am pleased to present for confirmation by the Senate the appointment of Professor Joash Amupitan, Senior Advocate of Nigeria, as chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
                            “Attached is his curriculum vitae, while hoping that the Senate will consider and confirm the appointment of the nominee in its usual expeditious manner.
                            “Please accept, distinguished Senate President, the assurances of my highest consideration.”
                            Senator Akpabio accordingly forwarded the request to the committee of the whole for legislative action as soon as practicable.
                            Details later…

                        <h2 class="news-title">Why I picked Amupitan as INEC chair – Tinubu</h2>
                        <p class="news-meta">Admin | Today, 2025</p>
                        <p class="news-excerpt truncated-text">President Bola Tinubu on Thursday explained that his choice of Professor Joash Amupitan (SAN) as the new Chairman of the Independent National 
                            Electoral Commission was based on his apolitical stance, integrity and impeccable record of service.             
                            “President Tinubu told the council that Amupitan is the first person from Kogi,  North-Central state, nominated to occupy the position and is apolitical,” a statement by Tinubu’s 
                            Special Adviser on Information and Strategy, Bayo Onanuga, quoted him as saying.<br> <br>
                        <span class="hidden-text">
                            The President spoke at the State House, Abuja, during the meeting of the National Council of State, which unanimously endorsed the nomination of Amupitan to succeed Professor Mahmood Yakubu, whose decade-long tenure as INEC Chairman ended on Tuesday.
                            Tinubu told council members that Amupitan, a professor of law from Kogi State, North-Central Nigeria, is the first person from the state to be nominated for the top electoral job.
                            Council members, including serving and former leaders, backed the nomination, describing the professor as a man of proven integrity.
                            Kogi State Governor, Usman Ododo, said Amupitan’s track record “reflects a deep commitment to justice, knowledge, and national service.”<br> <br>
                            Following the council’s approval, the President is expected to transmit Amupitan’s name to the Senate for screening and confirmation in line with constitutional provisions.Aged 58, Amupitan hails from Ayetoro Gbede in Ijumu Local Government Area of Kogi State.
                            A professor of law at the University of Jos, Plateau State, he is currently the institution’s Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Administration) and also serves as the Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of the Governing Council of Joseph Ayo Babalola University in Osun State.                            He obtained his Bachelor’s, Master’s, and Doctorate degrees in law from the University of Jos, after earlier studies at the Kwara State Polytechnic, Ilorin.
                            Called to the Nigerian Bar in 1988, Amupitan has built an extensive academic and administrative career spanning over three decades.
                            He became a Senior Advocate of Nigeria in 2014 and has written extensively on company law, corporate governance, and evidence law.<br> <br>
                            His published works include Corporate Governance: Models and Principles (2008), Documentary Evidence in Nigeria (2008), Evidence Law: Theory and Practice in Nigeria (2013), and Principles of Company Law (2013).
                            Beyond academia, Amupitan has served on several boards, including Integrated Dairies Limited in Vom, the Nigerian Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, and the Council of
                            He was also a board member of Riss Oil Limited, Abuja, between 1996 and 2004.
                            The Kogi-born scholar, described by colleagues as “a jurist of quiet influence,” is married with four children.
                            When confirmed by the Senate, Amupitan will become Nigeria’s 15th INEC chairman.

                        <p class="news-excerpt truncated-text ">Nigeria’s women’s basketball team, D’Tigress, have been drawn alongside hosts France, Germany, Korea, Colombia, and the Philippines in the Lyon-Villeurbanne group for the
                            2026 FIBA Women’s Basketball World Cup Qualifying Tournament, scheduled to take place from March 11 to 17, 2026, PUNCH Sports Extra reports.
                            The draw, conducted on Tuesday at the Patrick Baumann House of Basketball in Mies, Switzerland, marks the final step in determining the teams that will compete at next year’s World Cup in Berlin, Germany.<br> <br>
                        <span class="hidden-text">
                            Twenty-four nations will take part across four host cities, Wuhan in China, Lyon-Villeurbanne in France, San Juan in Puerto Rico, and Istanbul in Turkey, with 16 ultimately qualifying for the main event.
                            The draw was conducted by German national player Marie Guelich and former French captain Endy Miyem, in the presence of FIBA Secretary General Andreas Zagklis and representatives from participating federations.
                            Nigeria, having already qualified for the finals after winning the 2025 FIBA Women’s AfroBasket in August, will seek to extend their impressive run on the continent to the global stage in the qualifiers.
                            Their latest continental triumph earned them a spot among Africa’s four representatives, alongside Mali, Senegal, and South Sudan, in the qualifiers. <br> <br>
                            FIBA’s Central Board had earlier approved the expansion of the Women’s World Cup to 16 teams, a move aimed at providing more opportunities for emerging basketball nations.
                            The 2026 qualifying format will see 24 teams divided into four tournaments of six teams each. The top three teams from each group will qualify for the World Cup, alongside the winners of the continental championships and the host nation, Germany.
                            Nigeria will head into the qualifiers as one of the four continental champions, alongside Australia (Asia Cup winners), Belgium (EuroBasket winners), and the United States (AmeriCup winners).<br> <br>
                            For D’Tigress, the Lyon-Villeurbanne draw presents a challenging yet familiar path. The Nigerians will face France, one of Europe’s powerhouses, and German. Also in their group are Korea, Colombia, and the Philippines, all vying for one of the remaining tickets to Berlin.
                            The African champions will be making their third appearance at the global showpiece, having previously featured in 2006 and 2018, when they achieved a historic eighth-place finish, the best-ever by an African nation.
                            The qualifiers follow a long process that began with the FIBA Women’s Basketball World Cup Pre-Qualifying Tournaments held in August 2024 in Kigali, Rwanda, and Mexico City, Mexico.
                            Hungary and Czech Republic emerged as the two winners from those events, securing their places in the 2026 qualifying stage.
                            he FIBA Women’s Basketball World Cup 2026 will take place in Berlin, Germany, from September 4 to 13, 2026.

                        <p class="news-meta">Admin | Yesterday, 2025</p>
                        <p class="news-excerpt truncated-text">The Federal Government on Thursday formally presented Judge Dr Taoheed Elias as Nigeria’s candidate for election to the International Court of Justice, calling for international support to restore 
                            West Africa’s voice on the bench of the world’s top judicial body. The event, held in Abuja, brought together members of the diplomatic corps and senior government officials, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Yusuf Tuggar, 
                            led the endorsement of Dr Elias’ candidacy. Tuggar highlighted the absence of West African representation on the ICJ since 2011 and Nigeria’s lack of presence on the court for more than three decades.
                            “This long absence is not a matter of pride but of perspective. It underscores the importance of equitable geographical representation and the need for voices from West Africa to again be heard within the world’s highest judicial body,”
                        <span class="hidden-text">    
                            the minister said.<br> <br> Introducing the nominee, Tuggar described Elias as a distinguished jurist whose experience and integrity epitomise the standards set out in Article 2 of the ICJ Statute. He stressed that Elias was not merely a national
                            candidate but “a candidate for the international community.” “Elias embodies the envisaged qualities — a person of high moral character possessing the qualifications for the highest judicial office and recognised competence in international law.
                            “He is a Nigerian national, a distinguished scholar, a seasoned international civil servant, and a respected judge,” the minister stated. The minister noted that Elias’ candidacy “reflects the very ideals that unite us as members of the diplomatic 
                            community — integrity, competence, and commitment to justice.” ddressing the diplomatic corps, Tuggar also explained the broader purpose of the nomination. “This candidacy is not about Nigeria alone. It is about ensuring that Africa, 
                            and West Africa in particular, retains its rightful presence in shaping the global rule of law,” he added. In his remarks, Elias expressed pride in being presented as Nigeria’s candidate for the ICJ and spoke of his career-long dedication 
                            to the practice and development of international law. The significance of the court, he said, “The ICJ is at the cornerstone of the entire architecture of the United Nations, being responsible for the peaceful resolution of disputes.” “The first 
                            element of my candidacy is my academic background and intellectual expertise in international law. The second is my knowledge of the principal constituencies of the ICJ — the UN itself. The third element I want to highlight is my judicial experience. 
                            “I have spent more than 20 years in the United Nations system as a lawyer.<br> <br> These are things I’ve actually lived, in addition to teaching about them.” Currently serving as a judge ad hoc on the ICJ, Elias described the role as a significant opportunity that underscores his qualifications. 
                            “In the International Court of Justice, when you have a case, one party has a judge of their country on the court. The other country, which does not, can appoint anyone. Equatorial Guinea didn’t pick somebody from their own country; they picked me,” he said. 
                            Elias also acknowledged the weight of succeeding Judge Abdulqawi Yusuf of Somalia, a former president of the ICJ. Drawing a connection between his background and the current demands of the court, Elias said, “Given the nature of the challenges that I described, 
                            I think that a wider profile, perspective, and deeper appreciation in practice are things that I hope you believe will be of value to the court.” Elections for the ICJ are scheduled for November 12, 2025, to fill the seat vacated by Judge Yusuf.
                            If successful, Elias would become the fourth Nigerian to serve on the ICJ, following in the footsteps of Charles Onyeama, Bola Ajibola, and his father, Taslim Elias.
                            <br> <br>He is a member of the Institut de Droit International and has served as Legal Adviser and Director at the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in The Hague.
                            He is also the current President of the Administrative Tribunal of the OPEC Fund for International Development, Chairman of the Islamic Development Bank Administrative Tribunal, and a former President and member of the OPEC Appeals Committee.
                            The ICJ, commonly regarded as the highest court for resolving disputes between sovereign states, was established in 1945. It serves as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations and is based in The Hague, Netherlands.

                        <p class="news-meta">Admin | 14th OCtober, 2025</p>
                        <p class="news-excerpt truncated-text">The Senate on Thursday dismissed allegations of a “Christian genocide” in Nigeria, describing the claims made by US Senator Ted Cruz and television 
                            host Bill Maher as false, divisive, and capable of undermining national unity.
                            Lawmakers, while debating a motion titled “Urgent Need to Correct Misconceptions Regarding the Purported ‘Christian Genocide’ Narrative in Nigeria and International Communities,” 
                            resolved to work closely with the Federal Government on more effective counter-terrorism strategies to address insecurity.<br> <br>
                            <span class="hidden-text">
                            The motion, sponsored by Senator Mohammed Ali Ndume (Borno South) and co-sponsored by Senators Sani Musa (Niger East), Magatakarda Wamakko (Sokoto North), Ibrahim Bomai (Yobe South), 
                            and Ahmed Aliyu Wadada (Nasarawa West), among others, sought to counter what senators described as dangerous misinformation circulating in international media.
                            Seconding the motion, Senator Magatakarda Wamakko denounced the genocide narrative as “outright misinformation aimed at destroying our nation.”
                            “This misinformation cannot continue like this. We must take decisive steps to address this issue,” he said.<br> <br>
                            Also speaking, Senator Sumaila Kawu (Kano South) warned that such unfounded allegations could strain Nigeria’s international relations and fuel sectarian tension. Kawu said, 
                            “It is very common knowledge to us that nobody is supporting any act of terrorism in Nigeria. The government is doing its best to make sure we are living in a conducive atmosphere.
                            Some of the leaders of the Christian Association of Nigeria in my own state are members of the security council and traditional institutions.
                            “If they pass the bill in the US, it will be dangerous to us, both Christians and Muslims in Nigeria.<br> <br> I am seriously worried that the US Congress or a ranking US senator will come up with a very uninformed position.
                            As a parliament, we must join hands with our government to inform the US government and the US parliament that the position they are taking is not in tandem with what is going on.”
                            In his contribution, Senator Jimoh Ibrahim (Ondo South) called for a deeper national rethink on terrorism and security, urging the Senate to help redefine the country’s counter-terrorism framework.
                            “We must come to terms to understand the strategies, tactics, and practices of the terrorists. We must now engage the government on counter-terrorism measures.
                            “We must engage knowledge. We must go into executive session to define and redefine our counter-terrorism measures,” Ibrahim stated.<br> <br>
                            The controversy was triggered after US Senator Ted Cruz, in a podcast with television host Bill Maher, claimed that Christians were being “systematically targeted and killed” in Nigeria — a situation he described as genocide.
                            Maher and political commentator Van Jones echoed similar claims, accusing the Nigerian government of failing to protect Christian communities.
                            The Federal Government swiftly rejected the assertions, insisting that the nation’s security crisis stems from terrorism, banditry, and criminality — not religious persecution The Senate’s Thursday resolution signals a coordinated 
                            effort to engage the executive arm in designing stronger counter-terrorism strategies and diplomatic responses to correct what lawmakers described as a distorted foreign narrative about Nigeria.
                            Further deliberation on the motion has been adjourned to next Tuesday.

                        <h2 class="news-title">Tinubu’s reforms: I support 80 percent of what FG has done but...</h2>
                        <p class="news-meta">Admin | 13th October, 2025</p>
                        <p class="news-excerpt truncated-text "> The Emir of Kano and former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Muhammad Sanusi II, 
                            said he agrees with about 80 percent of President Bola Tinubu’s policy direction but has reservations about certain 
                            aspects of fiscal management and food importation.<br>
                            <span class="hidden-text"> Speaking in an interview with News Central on Tuesday, Sanusi 
                                commended the administration for stabilising the economy through improved fiscal discipline and better monetary policy coordination.<br>
                                “In terms of monetary policy and stability, I have nothing but commendation for the government. On the fiscal side, we have had an 
                                improvement in revenue-to-GDP ratios, improvement in debt service ratios, and a contraction in the deficit. These are positive steps, 
                                but we still have a long way to go,” he said. <br> <br>The former CBN governor, however, noted that while the government had made 
                                commendable progress in revenue generation, it must pay closer attention to the quality and efficiency of public spending.<br>
                                “I would like to see a better look at fiscal expenditure. We’re still spending too much money on government
                                <br>on the cost of governance, too many political appointees, too many officers,” Sanusi said. <br>
                                “If we do not improve the quality of spending and put a rein on expenditure, we’re going to continue borrowing.”<br> He warned that Nigeria 
                                could fall back into a debt trap if it failed to manage its post-subsidy savings prudently.
                                <br> <br>“After saving money from these expensive subsidies, after building up the government balance sheet, you go and spend it, and then you have to borrow again,” he cautioned. 
                                “So we still have some steps to go on the fiscal side, but the first thing was to fix revenue, and I think with the tax reforms and what you’ve seen so far, 
                                the fiscal side is on its way.Sanusi also called for structural reforms in agriculture, describing the government’s policy on food importation as counterproductive.
                                “I would like to see that we put a stop to the mass importation of food. I know it was driven by a desire to bring down food prices, but it is, in the end, very counterproductive to 
                                domestic production and domestic producer prices,” he said. <br> <br>According to him, Nigeria must focus on strengthening its agricultural value chain to boost local food production and achieve
                                sustainable food security.“Hopefully, we will get to a point where we go back on track with the reforms in the agricultural sector — fixing the agricultural value chain and relying on
                                domestic production to feed the nation,” he said. Summing up his assessment, the Emir of Kano said the administration had made significant strides despite the country’s economic challenges.
